# Moon-Phase-Calculator
GUI Moon Phase Calculator Program

An application and interface that tells the user the moon phase for a particular date that they input, as well as the number of days until the next full moon. Using python and graphical user interface (GUI), with the tkinter toolkit and PIL library, I created a user friendly, aesthetic, and accurate, software to provide the users with the moon phase based on their input date. The application promts the user for the date and the month from a drop down menu, and the year from a spinbox. These integer inputs are then used in a lengthy mathematical function calculation to determine the number of days the moon is into its cycle. This is in turn used in a series of if statements to provide the user with the relevant output when they press the Check button. At the bottom of the window, there is also a labelled visual diagram of the moon phases for the users to refer to.
