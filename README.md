MOON PHASE CALCULATOR

The only place beyond Earth that humans have truly explored, the Moon is one of the most important objects in our solar system,
responsible for interesting phenomena such as tides, and crucial to keeping our planet stable on its axis.

The Moon, of course, has been known since prehistoric times. It is the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun. As the
Moon orbits around the Earth once per month, the angle between the Earth, the Moon and the Sun changes. As humans, we see this
as the cycle of the Moonâ€™s phases. The time between each successive new moon is 29.5 days (709 hours).

The moon goes through eight cycles, Full Moon, Waxing Gibbous, First Quarter, Waxing Crescent, New Moon, Waning Crescent, Third
Quarter, Waning Gibbous, back to Full Moon. Just like the Sun's placement in the sky can help predict people's personality
traits and even influence current events, the phase the moon is in at any given time has a huge influence on a person's life,
mindset, and mood. Furthermore, the phases of the moon, particular the full moon, is used in many religions and cultures to
mark the celebration of a festival or a event. The Moon is a very important part of astrology, mythology and religion.

That's why I decided to make an application and interface that tells the user the moon phase for a particular date that they input,
as well as the number of days until the next full moon. Using python and graphical user interface (GUI), with the tkinter toolkit
and PIL library, I created a user friendly, aesthetic, and accurate, software to provide the users with the moon phase based on
their input date. The application promts the user for the date and the month from a drop down menu, and the year from a spinbox.
These integer inputs are then used in a lengthy mathematical function calculation to determine the number of days the moon is into
its cycle. This is in turn used in a series of if statements to provide the user with the relevant output when they press the
Check button. At the bottom of the window, there is also a labelled visual diagram of the moon phases for the users to refer to.
